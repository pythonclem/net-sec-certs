# Passing Network+ and Security+ With No Experience

**`My journey into IT certifications`**

   </br>

This write-up details my learning process and strategies I employed to pass the CompTIA Network+ and Security+ exams. My aim is to provide insight into my journey for those considering a similar path and to demonstrate my ability to learn and adapt.

## ðŸ“œ The Why

I pursued these two certifications to build foundational knowledge in the field. Coming from a marketing background in high-tech, Iâ€™ve always been around technology but felt I was missing basic knowledge necessary to advance. Chasing a certification gave me a tangible goal to work towards and something to show for my efforts. On April 3rd, 2024, I challenged myself to pass both certifications by the end of the month. I had the privilege of learning full-time, allowing me to spend about 8-10 solid hours studying each day, every day.

## ðŸ“œ The How

Learning a new topic from scratch requires a foolproof study plan, so I built one for Network+. Since it worked, I repeated it for Security+.
First, I watched all of Professor Messer's video series on YouTube at 1.25 speed. The series is extremely well-edited and doesn't waste a second, which I loved. I have watched many tutorials in the past few months, and none were paced like his. I managed to keep my focus for hours at a time.

While watching the videos, I paused and used ChatGPT to explain concepts I wasn't entirely familiar with. It was a great help to get on-demand explanations, especially when I could question further and verify my understanding. Learning is a lot about spaced repetition and slowly building an understanding of the topic. Professor Messerâ€™s videos are an amazing source of knowledge for these exams, and Iâ€™m thankful for all the material provided free of charge.

After four days of videos, I dove into the Exam Cram study book. I decided to summarize the entire 550 pages. I knew from experience that going through this exercise was the optimal way to learn quickly. Writing in my own words forces me to engage with the material on a much deeper level than simply reading it.

Summarizing the book took me three long days, and I have to admit that it was a struggle. To be honest, I didn't think the book was very good. I learned a lot summarizing it, but the order of presentation didn't feel logical to me, and there were multiple paragraphs copied and pasted in different chapters. I ended up with a 30+ page summary of all the concepts. I still have my summaries for Network+ and Security+, and theyâ€™re great reference points. Feel free to ask to see them!

By the end of that endeavor, I felt pretty well-prepared. I made about a hundred flashcards to memorize ports, cables, Wi-Fi standards, connectors, and other items requiring pure memorization. Iâ€™m not a big fan of memorizing things, but itâ€™s a necessary evil for certification.

Feeling prepared, I took a practice exam and scored 80%. While I was happy with the progress, I was not thrilled with the book I summarized, as some questions on the practice exam seemed to come out of nowhere. This is the one thing I didnâ€™t want to happen to me in the real exam.

I sought another source of knowledge and found Mike Meyers' book. In terms of content, it felt like the bible. I learned a lot of new things from it. I didn't feel the need to or have the mental capacity to summarize it like the first book, so I mostly looked for gaps in my knowledge, like acronyms or unfamiliar concepts. I enjoyed the book so much that I ended up reading all of it.
I continued with practice exams and decided to take the real exam once I could consistently score 90% or above. After a couple more days and about 14 practice exams later, I was ready. I bought my voucher, scheduled my exam for the next day, passed Network+, and repeated the process after a short weekend rest.

## ðŸ“œ The Lessons

As I was starting this journey I was looking to push myself, build foundational knowledge, and have it verified by a third party. I am happy to report that April was one of the most satisfying months Iâ€™ve experienced in a while, and that all three goals were successfully achieved. Now, on to practical experience!
